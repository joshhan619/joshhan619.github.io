Krita is one of the most popular free and open-source graphics editors for digital art. It is a software that I often use when I draw and it has a lot of interesting features like cutomizable brushes and a whole suite of tools for 2D animation. One of its most appealing qualities is that you can install plugins to enhance your workflow and add new functionality to Krita, of which many are community-developed and free of cost. One of my favorite plugins is [Pigment.O](https://github.com/EyeOdin/Pigment.O) which adds a colour wheel with an astonishing amount of customizability.

### The Idea ###
Included in Krita 5.1 by default, you can use the reference image tool to quickly add reference images into Krita from your computer or from your clipboard. When I draw on Krita, I usually spend a significant amount of time choosing the right references. This had led me to have dozens of tabs open on my web browser and multiple 3rd party reference tool applications installed on my computer. My goal was to provide convenient access to a repository of high-quality images to improve my workflow in Krita instead of leaving the application to search for reference images elsewhere.

### Krita Image Search ###
Krita Image Search is a Python plugin for Krita that is powered by [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com), a photography website with a large library of copyright-free photos. I developed this plugin to fix the problems I had when looking for reference images by creating an intuitive image search interface directly inside Krita. More information about Krita Image Search and how to install it into Krita are on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/joshhan619/krita_image_search).
